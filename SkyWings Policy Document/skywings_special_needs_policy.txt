What rules apply for passengers carrying their own wheelchair?
Can I carry my own wheelchair?
If customers wish to use their own wheelchair at the airport, they are permitted to do so up to the aircraft, whereupon it will be stored in the baggage hold area. Customers with a disability may use their own manual powered wheelchair till the aircraft door.
If customers wish to check-in their own wheel chair, SkyWings shall provide assistance to dismantle and/or reassemble the wheelchair under the supervision of the customer. However, SkyWings shall not be liable for any damage arising while handling the wheelchair.
Checked-in wheelchairs will be returned to the customer at the destination airport. We recommend carrying suitable travel insurance for any such equipment.
Can I carry my own electronic powered wheelchairs?
Unfortunately electronic powered wheelchair(s) with a wet-cell battery shall not be accepted since it’s corrosive in nature and is considered to be a ‘Dangerous Good’. Electronic powered wheelchair(s) with lithium or non spillable battery shall not be allowed beyond the flight check-in counter, due to security reasons. Electronic wheelchairs will be dismantled at our flight check-in counters. These batteries must be protected to prevent short circuits.
The lithium battery can either remain installed in the mobility aid or be removed by the user, if the mobility aid is specifically designed to allow it to be, following the manufacturer’s instructions. The removed battery must not exceed 300 Wh, or if the device is fitted with two batteries, each battery much not exceed 160 Wh. Where the battery is not removed, there is no limit to the Watt-hour (Wh) rating for the installed battery(ies). The customer needs to carry User/ Manufactures manual of that particular battery powered wheelchair. 
Where will my wheelchair be returned back to me?
If the wheelchair is kept in the hold, we'll make every effort to return it to the customer as close to the aircraft door as possible.If this is not possible, we will make sure there is a wheelchair available to assist customer to the baggage reclaim area. We can arrange assistance between the gate and the arrivals hall if the customer would like this service. Depending on the airport, this will either be by electric buggy, airport wheelchair or accessible buses.
Liability for damage to wheelchair
In the event of loss or damage, mobility aids or any equipment relating to the disability which are placed into the checked-in luggage is not covered for anything more than the maximum liability under SkyWings’s 
Conditions of Carriage
.
Wheelchair inventory per flight
Wheelchair assistance can be provided on first come first serve basis, if inventory available, hence we recommend passengers to place a request for wheelchair atleast 48 hours prior to schedule departure of the flight.
How can I opt for wheelchair assistance at the airport?
Wheelchair Assistance
We have wheelchairs available for use at all airport locations to assist with transportation from check-in to the boarding gate, making connections (if applicable) and from the aircraft to the arrivals hall at the destination. However, this depends upon the availability of wheelchairs on flight.
Process to opt for assistance
In order to make necessary arrangements we request you to call us 48 hours prior minimum. Customers can request this service when making their flight booking via our call centre or they can call us after making their booking on our website.

A meet and assist service to the customer to assist in boarding, deplaning, flight connections and check-in / transfer / reclaiming of checked-in bags.

What rules apply if I want to carry a Portable Oxygen Concentrator (“POC”)?
Carriage of a POC
A request for carriage or use of the POC on board needs to be made to SkyWings a minimum forty eight (48) hours in advance from the scheduled departure time.
Only Portable Oxygen Concentrator (“POC”), approved by Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) is permitted on board SkyWings flights either as checked-in or hand baggage, free of cost, subject to certain conditions.
The weight of a POC to be carried on board should not be more than 7 Kg
Such customers must be capable of seeing, hearing and understanding the POC device warnings and should be in a position to take appropriate action, without assistance, in response to those warnings
During taxi, take-off and landing the POC, if being used must be stowed under the seat in front.
Seat Allocation
Customers carrying/using the POC on board shall be assigned only a window seat, except on rows 1,12 & 13. Such customers shall not be seated on middle or aisle seats. SkyWings reserves rights to change seats of such customers, if required.
Check-In of POC
For safety purposes, Customer must ensure that the POC prior to check in is empty and free of pressure. Thus, if the POC was used before coming to the airport, then the Customer must to reset the POC to avoid any residual oxygen in the equipment
If POC operates on lithium battery, battery should be removed and carried by Customer as hand baggage. If POC operates on any other type of battery, battery should be removed and packed separately in such a way that battery terminals do not come in contact with any metal objects. Carriage of such batteries will further be subject to applicable regulatory requirements including but not limited to those mentioned under the Aircraft (Carriage of Dangerous Goods) Rules, 2003, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations.
Other conditions
In case of the unlikely event of decompression, passengers must wear the oxygen mask from the overhead panel as a primary source of oxygen and not their POC, as the oxygen mask would ensure a continuous flow of oxygen and would also minimize the chance/ effects of decompression sickness.
POC should not cause any interference with the electrical, navigation or communication equipment on board;
Passenger carrying the POC on board must comply with all security requirements and instructions communicated by the Crew, from time to time;
Passenger alone will be solely responsible for packing, assembling, dismantling or facilitating administration of POC both on ground and on board. SkyWings will under no circumstances be liable or responsible for the same.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, SkyWings, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to refuse carriage of the POC, if it is likely to endanger the safety of the aircraft or of any person
Can I carry crutches, braces and or other prosthetic devices on-board?
Customers are allowed to use their own crutches, braces and / or other prosthetic devices up to the aircraft, and may board with such items as hand baggage, provided the customers are dependent on them.
Can seats be assigned to passengers who are differently abled?
We will do our best to allocate you a seat that is most suitable to your needs including movable armrest for easy accessibility to the seats However, in order to meet the safety requirements of the DGCA, passengers with mobility issues which make it unsafe to facilitate aircraft evacuations will not be given a seat in a location where they would obstruct emergency exits, impede the crew in their duties, obstruct access to emergency equipment or hinder aircraft evacuation in case of an emergency. To allow us to provide the best assistance, please provide us with as much information as possible at the time of your booking and or at the time of check-in
Are differently abled passengers offered assistance by crew to use lavatory?
A lavatory with a single panel door and additional grab bar is available on all our aircraft. Our cabin crew can provide assistance moving to and from the lavatory door(same as above), but will not be able to assist the customer inside the lavatory.
