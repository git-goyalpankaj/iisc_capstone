Call the Customer Care at 0124-4973838 to book your ticket

Please provide your itinerary details to the customer care agent
Customer Care agent will create the PNR based on the itinerary and connect you to the IVR for payment

On successful card validation, an e-ticket will be created by the Customer Care and a copy would be emailed to the email address provided in your booking.
What are the benefits of calling call center to make booking?
The benefits of using the IVR system are:
You can book your tickets while on the move
Your entire transaction is completed in a single telephone call
Payment through IVR ensures security of your credit card information, as the credit card information is punched in the IVR system and is not verbally informed to the Contact Centre agent. The credit card details are encrypted (128 bit secure socket layer, SSL) and are masked in the PNR / reservation record and are not accessible to the contact centre staff
How should I book a ticket if I don’t have a surname?
In case, you don’t have a surname mentioned in your government ID, you can use your first name as your surname during your booking.
For example: A person with a name ‘XYZ’ can fill their surname as ‘XYZ’ during the booking. This way the booking would be made in the name of (Title) XYZ XYZ.
